\usage{
getV.spline(Z, T)
}
\arguments{
  \item{Z}{location data in complex form (X + iY)}

  \item{T}{time of observations (NOTE: must be regularly
  spaced for methods "vaf" and "crw")}
}
\value{
a list with the estimated velocity (V), as well as the
position (Z) and time (T).
}
\description{
