The original data was simulated with time intervals of 0.01 (leading to a complete track with 6000 data points). 200 points were randomly sampled from the \"true\" movement track, such that the intervals between locations are random with mean interval 0.3 units. \n}\n\\usage{data(Simp)}\n\\format{ Data frame (of class \"track\") containing 200 rows and three columns:\n\\describe{\n\\item{Time}{times of observation} \n\\item{X, Y}{coordinates}   \n}}\n\\source{\nFor more details, see: \\url{http://wiki.cbr.washington.edu/qerm/index.php/Behavioral_Change_Point_Analysis}\n}\n\\examples{\ndata(Simp)\nplot(Simp)\n}\n\\keyword{datasets}\n",
